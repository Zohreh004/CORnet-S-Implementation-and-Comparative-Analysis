## ðŸ§  Comparative & Implementation Reports on CORnet-S

This repository contains two complementary reports produced as part of a Computational Cognitive Neuroscience project (Summer 2025). Both reports focus on analyzing and experimenting with **CORnet-S**, a biologically inspired recurrent neural network, and comparing its behavior to a feedforward **ResNet-18** model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Included Reports
- **Comparative & Temporal Analysis Report**  
  Explores how classification confidence evolves across stages in ResNet-18 versus across recurrent time steps in CORnet-S, highlighting their structural and temporal differences in building decision confidence.

- **Implementations Report**  
  Documents the full implementation workflow of adapting CORnet-S to the CIFAR-10 dataset, including setup, model adaptation, performance evaluation, and visualizations of layer-wise activations and class activation maps.

These reports provide both the theoretical background and practical implementation details necessary to understand the dynamics, performance, and interpretability of CORnet-S compared to traditional feedforward architectures.
